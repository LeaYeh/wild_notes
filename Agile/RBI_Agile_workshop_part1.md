# Agile

* Software Development Lift Cycle (SDLC)
* Rational Unified Process (RUP)
    - A company create a devflow mix waterfall and agile

* waterfall
    - phase oriented
        - can not go back to previous phase
        - if the request change -> start from 0
    - lots of handivers/silos
    - documentation, need to think...
        - who make it?
        - who read it?
        - how often people will read it?

* when we should use waterfall
    - clear idea
    - speed is not crucial
    - no doubt about what needs to be done
    - e.g. building a bridge

* Scrum
    - Framework
        - fast feedback
        - continuse improvment
        - rapid adaptation
    - role
        - developers
        - product owner
            - maintaining the product blacklog
        - scrum master
    - artifact
        - product backlog
            - orfered list of what is needed to build/improve a product
        - sprint backlog
            - what should be the goal of this sprint (2-4 weeks)
            - after sprint deliever working software
            - commitment
                - ready
                - done
                - sprint goal
                    - what you want to see after end of the sprint
                - product goal
        - backlog item
        - increment
    - ceremonies

* if we work in a startup company (2 developers), agile is needed be the scrum would over kill

* Agile model / manifesto
    - individual and interaction
    - working software
    - customer collaboration
    - responding to change

- always delievery `working software`
- need to maintain constant pase
- self-organizing team
    - no one will tell you what you have to do


# Extreme Programming

1. Requirements Gathering
    - Collaborate closely with customers to collect and understand requirements.
    - Record requirements as user stories, prioritizing them accordingly.
2. Iterative Development
    - Divide the development process into short cycles (usually 1-2 weeks), delivering working software at the end of each iteration.
3. Pair Programming and TDD
    - Team members work in pairs, following the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) to write code and test cases.
4. Continuous Integration and Refactoring
    - Integrate code changes continuously to ensure the stability of the codebase.
    - Regularly refactor code to maintain simplicity and high quality.
5. Customer Feedback and Improvement
    - At the end of each iteration, review the results with the customer to gather feedback and make improvements.
    - Adjust priorities and development plans based on feedback.
